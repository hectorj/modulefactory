Important note : this project isn't finished, and is in stand-by. I may start working on it again later. For now results are variable, and it seems there is still some bugs. If someone want to use this code, go ahead.

moduleFactory tool to easily create bases of a Magento's module (Magento CE >= 1.5).


----


Online tool is available here : http://modulefactory.hectorj.net/ [not available anymore]


----


moduleFactory uses jQuery (http://jquery.com/), jQueryUI (http://jqueryui.com/) and jsTree (http://www.jstree.com/).

It has been tested thanks to [https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/ PHPUnit], and [https://github.com/IvanChepurnyi/EcomDev_PHPUnit Ivan Chepurnyi's extension].
